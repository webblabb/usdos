# License

This Beta Testing End User License Agreement (EULA) is a legal agreement between ___________________________ (either an individual or an entity (“Licensee”)) for the beta version of United States Disease Outbreak Simulation Software (USDOS) and the Board of Governors of the Colorado State University acting by and through Colorado State University, an entity under the Laws of the State of Colorado, having an address at 1062 Campus Delivery; Fort Collins, CO 80523-1062 (“Licensor”). Collectively the Licensee and Licensor may be referred to as the Parties.
Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Licensor grants Licensee a personal, nonexclusive and nontransferable license to use USDOS, any output of USDOS, and any documentation that supports or describes USDOS regardless of format (e.g., physical, electronic version) for testing and evaluation purposes (beta testing) during the term of this EULA unless this EULA is terminated. This EULA is only for beta testing. Although USDOS and any output may be used by Licensee during beta testing, the primary purpose of beta testing is to evaluate whether USDOS functions for its intended purpose. No rights under this EULA can be transferred or assigned by Licensee absent prior written agreement of the Licensor.
By using USDOS, you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA and acknowledge that you have read and understand it.

Except as expressly authorized Licensee shall not: copy, in whole or in part, USDOS or any documentation; modify USDOS; reverse engineer compile or assemble all or any portion of USDOS; rent, lease, distribute, sell USDOS; remove or alter any notices or marks; attempt to influence a 3rd Party into a belief that any entity, other than Licensor, is the source of USDOS; or create derivative works of USDOS.

# General

USDOS is a Bayesian Model based software for estimating disease transmission through both long range and local routes between affected premises. USDOS only provides estimations and visualization functionality, it does not provide actual or historical data. While extensive effort has been made to ensure accuracy, USDOS is not a substitute for the commonsense, knowledge, and experience of a trained professional and should not be taken as such.
USDOS was developed by Licensor with support from the United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). The Government of the United States of America (the “Government”) has certain rights in the USDOS. Nothing in USDOS, any documentation, or this EULA shall be taken or otherwise interpreted as endorsement or representing the position or policies of DHS, USDA, or the Government with respect to USDOS or the Licensor. Licensor is solely responsible for the content of the USDOS, any accompanying documentation, or this EULA.
Nothing in USDOS, any accompanying documentation, or this EULA shall be taken as authorization or consent by DHS, USDA, or the Government under 28 U.S.C. §1498. The foregoing does not exclude or prevent the Government from exercising or providing its authorization or consent under 28 U.S.C. §1498 at its sole discretion.

# Term and Termination

This EULA is effective until terminated. Licensee may terminate this EULA at any time by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice to Licensor, discontinue use of the USDOS and ceasing to use/destroying any output of USDOS and any documentation. Notwithstanding the Term and Termination provision above, this EULA will terminate immediately without notice from Licensor if Licensee fails to comply with any provision of this EULA. Upon termination, Licensee will cease all use of the USDOS, and cease use/destroy any output and/or documentation that supports or describes USDOS regardless of format (e.g., physical, electronic version).
